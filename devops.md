## Continuos Integration

**GitFlow** is a branching model for version control using Git that provides a structured workflow for teams working on code repositories. It separates work into different branches like feature branches, release branches, and hotfix branches. The main benefits of GitFlow include clear structure, isolation of work, efficient version control, simplified release management, and enhanced collaboration and code review. Overall, GitFlow streamlines development, improves code quality, and facilitates teamwork.
