# Used DevOps concepts
DevOps is a software development approach that combines development and operations teams to streamline processes and deliver high-quality software more efficiently. It fosters collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement. The benefits of DevOps include increased collaboration and communication, continuous integration and delivery, faster time to market, improved software quality, enhanced reliability and stability, scalability and flexibility, continuous monitoring and feedback, and cost optimization. Overall, DevOps aligns teams, accelerates software delivery, improves quality, and enhances customer satisfaction.

## Issue Control

Issue control in a DevOps project refers to the management and resolution of problems or difficulties that arise during the development, implementation, and continuous operation of a system or software. It involves the proactive identification of issues, registration and tracking of problems, prioritization, resolution, communication, and continuous learning. Effective issue control helps teams identify and address problems quickly, improving the quality of the delivered software and user satisfaction.
For issue control in this project, we used documentation methodologies and integration between software as a basis for documentation, in particular:

- Github -> We used github to create a board with the tasks defined for each sprint, in addition to documenting each one as issues within github. Which allows us to create assignments from the creation of a branch to the link in commits. [Board link](https://github.com/orgs/PhatomFatec/projects/5/views/1) 

- [Zube](https://zube.io/) -> We use zube in conjunction with github, promoting a very valuable integration for documentation and control of issues related to this project. From applying the agile methodology used ([Scrum](https://www.atlassian.com/br/agile/scrum) ) to creating dashboards and reports for task monitoring
